# Fake News Detection

A data analysis challenge with the Kaggle dataset "Fake News Detection" by Khushi Kyad. 

We'll focus on answearing 3 key questions:
1. What is the correlation between clickbait score and de number of shares?
2. What is the mean distribution of the number os words for Health and Sports?
3. What are the three most reliable sources based on trust_score, source_reputation and fact_check_rating?


## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The project uses the ["Fake News Detection" dataset by Khushi Kyad from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/fake-news-detection/data). 

This dataset contains approximately 40,000 news articles with the following features:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each article
- `title`: Headline of the news article
- `author`: Author of the article
- `text`: Content of the news article
- `label`: Classification (1 = Fake News, 0 = Real News)

The dataset is well-balanced with articles from various sources and covers a range of topics, making it suitable for building a robust fake news classifier (wich will be implemented in the future).
